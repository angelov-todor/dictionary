## RESTful doc

Restful documentation is based on [ApiBlueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/).

To generate a beauty html doc you could use [Aglio](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/aglio).

To build the doc in html in `dist/api.html` you can use preferably `yarn` (or `npm`)

```
yarn
yarn build
```

or `npm`
```
npm install; npm prune
npm run build
```
